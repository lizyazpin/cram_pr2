reaching pose `pose' through calculating a trajectory via inverse
kinematics solution for side `side'. All intermediate trajectory
points between the starting joint-state and the final trajectory point
are taken into account. `nil' is returned when no inverse kinematics
solution could be found. Optionally, the constraint aware IK solver
service can be used by setting the parameter `constraint-aware' to
`t'. When `calc-euclidean-distance' is set to `t', the euclidean
distance is used. Otherwise, the (unweighted) quadratic joint-space

is fundamentally different."
